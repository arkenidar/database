rdbg --open --port 12345 -- bin/rails server

Or for a plain Ruby script:

rdbg --open --port 12345 -- ruby my_script.rb

--open → allows remote debugger connections
--port 12345 → choose any free port

3. Configure VS Code to Attach

In VS Code, open .vscode/launch.json (create it if it doesn’t exist) and add:

{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Attach to Ruby Process",
      "type": "rdbg",
      "request": "attach",
      "debugPort": 12345,
      "localfs": true
    }
  ]
}

4. Attach the Debugger

In VS Code, go to Run and Debug (Ctrl+Shift+D / Cmd+Shift+D).
Select Attach to Ruby Process from the dropdown.
Click the green ▶ button.

5. Debug Normally

Set breakpoints in your Ruby files.
Use the Debug Console to inspect variables.
Step through code as usual.

✅ Tip:
If you’re using Ruby LSP in VS Code, it already integrates with the debug gem, so you don’t need extra extensions like VSCode Ruby Debugger — just ensure "type": "rdbg" is used in launch.json.

If you want, I can give you a ready-to-use Rails + Ruby LSP debug setup so you can start and attach in one click.
Do you want me to prepare that?
